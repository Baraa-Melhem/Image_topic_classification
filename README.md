Science is always advancing, with the current trend 
leaning towards automating daily tasks and relying 
more on machines. While it's hard to imagine 
completely replacing human roles, there's a positive 
movement to elevate human competition against 
machines. In this project, we're focused on 
developing an artificial intelligence model that can 
identify topics from text within images and 
categorize them based 
on content.
It's important to note that the project might have 
some issues, and the model's accuracy might not 
be perfect right now.

to try the project open this python program : "image to text.py"
then replace the path in  this code img = cv2.imread(r"C:\Users\User\Desktop\Artificial intelligence\Machine learning\Deep learning\Image topic classification\image exp\site-ad-bb-ball-2022_orig.jpg")
into the path of your image 

put the class program "text_cleaner.py" in the same file of the program  "image to text.py" 
don't forget to install libraries of the class program  "text_cleaner.py" and libraries of "image to text.py" before you run the code
